# simple node application to pass webhooks to discord

## About

I built this to relay webhooks from prometheus event notifier to discord using webhooks.  Prometheus sends webhooks (designed for slack) but the recommended configuration of using the slack did not work for me.

## Built With

* [discord-webhook-node](https://github.com/darsys/discord-webhook-node) Allows fommmr easy webhook sending through discord's webhook API
* [express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
